These are the words you read. They are expressions of emotion in a medium with no emotion. 

Sandwiched between these colloquialisms, stories are told about growth and improvement. Nothing is said of the growth apart and improvement without.

Wanna meet on ft? FaceTime? Wanna emulate physical presence without literal physical presence? Tell an inside joke! Old memories make new memories seem possible. But these are old memories. But the mind forgets, so these are new memories. New memories with a new person who doesn't know the new you. 

This new person needs support, and you'd love to give them support. But you can't give them support. So you text, "I'm here for you." It's the thought that counts. But thoughts don't support people.

They say distance makes the heart grow fonder. It must have gotten too big, cause I'm pretty sure it's broken.
